# Go Dojo

This is a [dojo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dojo) to experiment with and learn from [Go](https://go.dev/).

# Benchmarks

Run benchmarks with `make bench`. These benchmarks will run a series of tests to answer the question "What is the fastest way to do X in Go?"

# Snippets

Here I might add little code snippets as I experiment with things.
